        Don't look around you just yet. You are currently in the game Minecraft. Your body has been turned into blocks
        and your face is now pixels on a Minecraft character's skin. This is your new digital reality for the time
        being. Don't freak out. You must survive the first night. Who knows what the consequences of dying in this world
        are?

      Welcome to the world of Minecraft. My name is Notch and I want to debrief you on the events currently happening in
      the world related to my beloved game and how I can help you fix them. If you are reading this,
      it means it is already too late, but I will try to give you as much information as I know to help you escape from
      whatever is causing this to happen.
      If you look around you, you'll see others stuck in the exact same situation as you. Bare with me please as I sum
      up a news report from the outside world:

      “The year is 2024 and the prevalence of technology has skyrocketed and people are dependent on it now more than
      ever.
      The video game market has seen its fair share of video games rise and fall throughout the years, but one game
      never seems to die fully: the popular sandbox game Minecraft.
    </p>

    <p class="special">
      In recent years, the popup of SMP servers such as the Dream SMP and HermitCraft has boosted Minecraft's popularity
      higher than ever.
      Videos on the subjects reach millions of views and streams hosted by streamers on various platforms such as Twitch
      and Youtube reach hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers.
      This switch from casual Minecraft survival let's plays to the roleplaying nature of SMP servers has made Minecraft
      entertainment soar once again to its peak viewership with millions of people watching the Dream SMP's finale
      and fans of the storyline being littered over the internet. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.
    </p>

    <p class="special">
      For the last year, people have been reported going missing from their homes. It seems as if some mysterious entity
      has been targeting famous Minecraft content creators for the last year.
      Streamers such as Thomas Simons (known as “TommyInnit”) and Felix Kjellberg (known as “PewDiePie”) who have
      generated a lot of content from Minecraft and built a viewership with the game have mysteriously disappeared from
      the world.
      A more detailed list of all missing persons is given at the bottom of this document titled “Missing Person
      Posters”. There is absolutely no trace of how the mysterious entity successfully performed the kidnappings or why
      they did it.
      The only clue left behind is that each person was playing Minecraft before disappearing. It's as if they were
      playing Minecraft at one moment and then simply disappeared the next. How the perpetrator is capable of this is
      beyond any comprehension we have at the moment,
      but police forces across the world are investigating these incidents. Kids are scared to pick up the game and play
      it due to these disappearances. People have had speculations on how these events came to pass
      and who possibly could have done it, but the popularity of the event has led everyone to one name: <span
        class="glitch" data-text="HEROBRINE"> HEROBRINE </span>
    </p>

    <p class="special">
      A quick internet search will reveal that Herobrine is simply a community made character that cannot possibly
      exist, and is the basis behind many creepypastas and Minecraft's story as well.
      Hundreds of fan theories have been created to explain who Herobrine is, but the truth is simple. Herobrine is an
      online persona that has no basis in real life.
    </p>

    <h2 class="special"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The world is simply TERRIFIED <br> </span>
      <span style="font-weight: 100; font-size: small;"> especially the youth who grew up watching these content
        creators. </span>
    </h2>

    <p class="special">
      After reading this article, I found it extremely suspicious that the kidnappings seemed to target extremely
      popular Minecraft content creators.
      My once beloved game became the motive behind all these kidnappings and I felt compelled to figure out the truth.
      I wanted to catch whoever was behind all of this.
      Who could be so cruel and clever as to take away people from their families and tear the Minecraft community apart
      all without leaving a single trace of their doing?
      While people may believe it was Herobrine,
      it is simply impossible. I never even coded it into the game. Herobrine is a figment of people's imagination.
    </p>

    <p class="special">
      Thanks to my previous work at Mojang on this game, I was able to create a backdoor that allows me to access the
      source code and make changes at will (don't tell Microsoft about it), and this allows me to communicate to you
      all. I did some digging and I noticed that a world was encoded directly into the game's main database.
      Curious, I clicked on the file and to my horror I saw the names of every content creator that went missing as
      character files in this new world. This is when I realized that you all were trapped in this game.
      I tried to signal this problem to Microsoft, but they simply called me crazy and denied me access to the
      decryption algorithm so I could log into your world. That didn't stop me however.
      I couldn't just let you all suffer in this Minecraft world so I spent weeks figuring out their decryption
      algorithm so I could send this message to you all.
      I can't quite see what you send in return but I hope my message gets to you safely.
    </p>

    <p class="special">
      Now, you may be wondering what your role is in all of this. To that I answer, I have no idea. It seems like
      everyone was suddenly transported into this Minecraft world together.
      You find yourself trapped with the other members inside a large hole with mysterious signs scattered around the
      hole saying “TRY TO SURVIVE”.
      I am currently looking through the game's history to try to figure out how this anomaly even happeneD but it is
      beyond me.

    <h2> THERE IS NO WAY OUT. THE SOONER YOU ACCEPT YOUR FATE. THE BETTER.</h2>

    <Content_block_component title="From Backroom">
      <p>
        Similarly to Jumanji, you are now stuck in the popular video game Minecraft and there is a lot of mystery
        surrounding how you got here.
        You'll find it inutile to find a way out of the game through its code and real world circumstances. You should
        consider yourselves
        fully immersed in the game and obeying its mechanics, but also retaining your previous memories and knowledge of
        the game.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Current Situation">
      <p>
        Everyone is currently trapped inside a massive unnatural hole with signs spread all throughout its walls with
        one message: “TRY TO SURVIVE”.
        Everyone can remember all the events leading up to your transferring into the game but no one can quite remember
        how they got into the game itself.
        From an outside perspective, the game still looks very blocklike, but inside the game everything looks
        incredibly realistic.
        Much like the game, your fists are able to break blocks of dirt in a second and you seem to be able to simply
        store items and take them out of thin air.
        Almost like everyone has a small pocket dimension to hold their items for them like an inventory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equipped with this new reality and information, a multitude of problems appear.
        The game after all is an open sandbox world, so delegates are free to venture off and explore as they wish, but
        now their own lives are at stake,
        and no one knows what truly happens when you die in the game. One important task becomes clear over the rest:
        How are you going to survive the night and how will you deal with the
        upcoming problems of this world.
        A simple glance around at the landscape shows that the world you have spawned in has become a lot more realistic
        and less resource abundant than you normally would have in Minecraft,
        making collaboration absolutely necessary if everyone wants to survive in this committee. The game has always
        been quite easy when playing on a computer,
        but now the difficulty level of the game is unknown and every action could have consequences that are dear to
        your very own lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        With time ticking, and the first night getting ever closer, there is no time to waste. Go out, explore, and
        enjoy navigating the seemingly harmless world of Minecraft!

    <Content_block_component title="The Concordia SMP">
      <p>
        The Minecraft server that this committee is based on will now be called the Concordia SMP.
        Every delegate in this committee represents a popular Minecraft content creator that either comes
        from standalone content or SMP servers. You are all trapped in the Minecraft world seemingly
        against your own will and there is no way out for you.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Delegates will have access to anything reasonable that could have been on them or in their room
        when they were transported into this game. These items will appear as special items in the game and
        will allow for characters to be creative with warping the mechanics of their game.
        Creativity within reason will allow delegates to slightly tweak what is known in Minecraft and
        potentially even give them an edge over the other members in committee.
        Delegates will be asked to specify these special items in the first note if they wish to bring any.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The Concordia SMP will be running on the latest version of Minecraft (1.21.4) and any mechanics
        from Minecraft will be available to the delegates in the committee. Delegates can also build upon
        Minecraft and attempt to introduce new mechanics that could realistically exist within Minecraft
        if you were transported into the game (for example, the ability to communicate with villagers or
        the various other mobs in the game will be allowed). Crisis updates will consist of updates directly to
        the committee's website that
        will be given to delegates' prior to the conference and displayed on the chair's screen as well.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Every delegate will have the following traits: a health bar, a number of lives,
        experience levels, armor and hunger in the game. Each trait is either classified as public or private,
        depending on its visibility to other delegates. Public traits will show up on the committee's website
        and delegates are free to inquire at any time about their own public traits or other's public traits.
        Private traits will be tracked in backroom through the double notepad system.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Health Bar (Public)" image-name="HeartWhole">
      <p>
        Tracks the amount of health each delegate has. It is measured in half hearts.
        Delegates have twenty half hearts (or ten full hearts) when they first spawn into the game.
        If a delegate's health bar ever depletes to zero hearts,
        they lose a life and have to respawn, granting them another full ten hearts again.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Armor (Public)" image-name="ArmorWhole">
      <p>
        represents a delegate's resistance to hostile actions within the game.
        Whether it be an attempted assassination or being exiled by the committee into the nether,
        a delegate's armor points will reduce the amount of hearts they would normally lose from the
        committee's different events.
        The more armor a delegate has, the less hearts they will lose from events.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Hunger (Public)" image-name="HungerWhole">
      <p>
        Building beyond simple hunger, things such as sickness, poison, heat and sanity
        will also affect a delegate's hunger. A delegate's hunger dropping below a certain threshold
        (that will remain hidden) will cause that delegate to start losing hearts,
        so make sure to stay healthy at all times.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Experience Levels (Private)">
      <p>
        represents the delegate's influence in committee. A delegate's experience level will
        serve as a primary indicator of how powerful their notes can be.
        The more experience levels a delegate has, the more they are capable of achieving in backroom.
        Experience levels can be obtained from more than just how they are habitually obtained in
        Minecraft and can also be obtained through note quality and character thematics.
        Much like the other traits, the experience level can be affected by frontroom directives.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Starting Stats">
      <p>
        Each delegate will start the game with three lives much like in the DreamSMP and this is subject
        to change depending on the events of the first committee session.
        Additionally, everyone's health bar and hunger will be set to full,
        while their armor will be set to empty. Experience levels will also be set to zero at the
        start of the committee.
        Crisis updates will almost always affect delegates' public traits and affect how the committee
        should be approaching problems. It is important to keep them in mind when drafting directives
        and a reminder that adhering to the game's mechanics, acknowledging them and building around
        them will allow delegates to accelerate their arcs quite quickly. Coming up with new mechanics
        and using them will also allow delegates to quickly accelerate their arcs. Here are a couple
        examples of realistic mechanics that could theoretically exist in Minecraft:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-element">
        <li>
          Using Redstone to create actual computers to communicate across the Minecraft land
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the game's ores to create new alloys that have unique properties
        </li>
        <li>
          Talking to the various mobs in the game
          (although there is much doubt zombies would be very interested in communicating)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Understandably, the committee being based in a video game may be extremely confusing so please feel
        free to reach out to us at any time concerning mechanics,
        and many of these mechanics will be reminded to delegates at the start of the committee.
      </p>
