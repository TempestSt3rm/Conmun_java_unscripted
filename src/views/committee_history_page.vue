            Don't look around you just yet. You are currently in the game Minecraft. Your body has been turned into blocks and your face is now pixels on a Minecraft character's skin. This is your new digital reality for the time being. Don't freak out. You must survive the first night. Who knows what the consequences of dying in this world are?

        Welcome to the world of Minecraft. My name is Notch and I want to debrief you on the events currently happening in the world related to my beloved game and how I can help you fix them. If you are reading this,
        it means it is already too late, but I will try to give you as much information as I know to help you escape from whatever is causing this to happen. 
        If you look around you, you'll see others stuck in the exact same situation as you. Bare with me please as I sum up a news report from the outside world:

            “The year is 2024 and the prevalence of technology has skyrocketed and people are dependent on it now more than ever. 
            The video game market has seen its fair share of video games rise and fall throughout the years, but one game never seems to die fully: the popular sandbox game Minecraft.
        </p>

            In recent years, the popup of SMP servers such as the Dream SMP and HermitCraft has boosted Minecraft's popularity higher than ever. 
            Videos on the subjects reach millions of views and streams hosted by streamers on various platforms such as Twitch and Youtube reach hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers. 
            This switch from casual Minecraft survival let's plays to the roleplaying nature of SMP servers has made Minecraft entertainment soar once again to its peak viewership with millions of people watching the Dream SMP's finale 
            and fans of the storyline being littered over the internet. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.
        </p>

        <p class="special">
            For the last year, people have been reported going missing from their homes. It seems as if some mysterious entity has been targeting famous Minecraft content creators for the last year. 
            Streamers such as Thomas Simons (known as “TommyInnit”) and Felix Kjellberg (known as “PewDiePie”) who have generated a lot of content from Minecraft and built a viewership with the game have mysteriously disappeared from the world. 
            A more detailed list of all missing persons is given at the bottom of this document titled “Missing Person Posters”. There is absolutely no trace of how the mysterious entity successfully performed the kidnappings or why they did it. 
            The only clue left behind is that each person was playing Minecraft before disappearing. It's as if they were playing Minecraft at one moment and then simply disappeared the next. How the perpetrator is capable of this is beyond any comprehension we have at the moment, 
            but police forces across the world are investigating these incidents. Kids are scared to pick up the game and play it due to these disappearances. People have had speculations on how these events came to pass 
            and who possibly could have done it, but the popularity of the event has led everyone to one name: <span class="glitch" data-text="HEROBRINE"> HEROBRINE </span>
        </p>

        <p class="special">
            A quick internet search will reveal that Herobrine is simply a community made character that cannot possibly exist, and is the basis behind many creepypastas and Minecraft's story as well. 
            Hundreds of fan theories have been created to explain who Herobrine is, but the truth is simple. Herobrine is an online persona that has no basis in real life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="special"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The world is simply TERRIFIED <br> </span> 
            <span style="font-weight: 100; font-size: small;"> especially the youth who grew up watching these content creators. </span>
        </h2>

        <p class="special">
            After reading this article, I found it extremely suspicious that the kidnappings seemed to target extremely popular Minecraft content creators. 
            My once beloved game became the motive behind all these kidnappings and I felt compelled to figure out the truth. I wanted to catch whoever was behind all of this. 
            Who could be so cruel and clever as to take away people from their families and tear the Minecraft community apart all without leaving a single trace of their doing? 
            While people may believe it was Herobrine, 
            it is simply impossible. I never even coded it into the game. Herobrine is a figment of people's imagination.

            Thanks to my previous work at Mojang on this game, I was able to create a backdoor that allows me to access the source code and make changes at will (don't tell Microsoft about it), and this allows me to communicate to you all. I did some digging and I noticed that a world was encoded directly into the game's main database. 
            Curious, I clicked on the file and to my horror I saw the names of every content creator that went missing as character files in this new world. This is when I realized that you all were trapped in this game. 
            I tried to signal this problem to Microsoft, but they simply called me crazy and denied me access to the decryption algorithm so I could log into your world. That didn't stop me however. 
            I couldn't just let you all suffer in this Minecraft world so I spent weeks figuring out their decryption algorithm so I could send this message to you all. 
            I can't quite see what you send in return but I hope my message gets to you safely.

            Now, you may be wondering what your role is in all of this. To that I answer, I have no idea. It seems like everyone was suddenly transported into this Minecraft world together.
            You find yourself trapped with the other members inside a large hole with mysterious signs scattered around the hole saying “TRY TO SURVIVE”. 
            I am currently looking through the game's history to try to figure out how this anomaly even happeneD but it is beyond me.

        <Content_block_component title="From Backroom">
            <p>
                Similarly to Jumanji, you are now stuck in the popular video game Minecraft and there is a lot of mystery surrounding how you got here. 
                You'll find it inutile to find a way out of the game through its code and real world circumstances. You should consider yourselves 
                fully immersed in the game and obeying its mechanics, but also retaining your previous memories and knowledge of the game.
            </p>
        </Content_block_component>

        <Content_block_component title="Current Situation">
            <p>
                Everyone is currently trapped inside a massive unnatural hole with signs spread all throughout its walls with one message: “TRY TO SURVIVE”. 
                Everyone can remember all the events leading up to your transferring into the game but no one can quite remember how they got into the game itself. 
                From an outside perspective, the game still looks very blocklike, but inside the game everything looks incredibly realistic.
                 Much like the game, your fists are able to break blocks of dirt in a second and you seem to be able to simply store items and take them out of thin air. 
                Almost like everyone has a small pocket dimension to hold their items for them like an inventory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equipped with this new reality and information, a multitude of problems appear. 
                The game after all is an open sandbox world, so delegates are free to venture off and explore as they wish, but now their own lives are at stake, 
                and no one knows what truly happens when you die in the game. One important task becomes clear over the rest: How are you going to survive the night and how will you deal with the 
                upcoming problems of this world. 
                A simple glance around at the landscape shows that the world you have spawned in has become a lot more realistic and less resource abundant than you normally would have in Minecraft, 
                making collaboration absolutely necessary if everyone wants to survive in this committee. The game has always been quite easy when playing on a computer, 
                but now the difficulty level of the game is unknown and every action could have consequences that are dear to your very own lives.
                <br>
                <br>
                With time ticking, and the first night getting ever closer, there is no time to waste. Go out, explore, and enjoy navigating the seemingly harmless world of Minecraft!
