    <Content_block_component title="History of Minecraft">
      <p>
        Minecraft is one of the biggest and most influential games in the world, and development and growth tell a
        remarkable story. Minecraft was first imagined by Swedish programmer Markus “Notch” Persson. Before applying all
        his focus on Minecraft, Notch developed prototypes of similar games during his few free hours including
        RubyDung, a base-building game, and Infinminer, a block-based mining game. Notch wanted to create a game that
        focused on both building and exploration. These prototypes were the building blocks of the game we know and love
        today.

      <br>
      <p>
        The first edition of Minecraft was written in Java and featured a simple blocky aesthetic, which became its
        signature style. Minecraft (Java Edition) was made during a weekend in early May 2009 and was initially released
        to the public on May 17th on the TIGSource forum, after the initial release Notch received feedback from his
        peers which he used to update the game to what is nowadays Minecraft Classic version. A few more updates were
        released during the next couple of months, the Indev and Infdevs versions, before the first major update, Alpha,
        which was released June 30, 2010 and then entered into its Beta phase in December 2010. These versions
        introduced crafting, survival mechanics, and the multiplayer mode. Players then started to purchase the game
        early on and received these updates, which contributed to the game's strong and active community. At this time
        Minecraft started to pick up speed.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As Minecraft is picking up speed, Notch decides to quit his day job and solely focus on the game. Notch then
        founded the now legendary video game company Mojang with colleagues Carl Manneh and Jakob Porser. The Mojang
        company grew at a rapid pace.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        On November 18th, 2011 Minecraft was officially released during Minecon, its inaugural fan convention, in Las
        Vegas. By this time, the game had already sold millions of copies. After the official release, many new features
        were added including Survival and Creative modes, the Nether and The End dimensions and a fan favourite redstone
        mechanics
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In September 2014, Microsoft purchased Mojang and Minecraft for $2.5 billion. Notch was the one who suggested
        via Twitter that he was looking for a corporation to buy his shares. He then left the company. Under new
        management, Minecraft continued to grow through updates and expansions. Alongside updates, Minecraft was adapted
        to be played on multiple platforms including Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, and Pocket Edition for mobile devices.
        Microsoft also created spin-offs of the base game including Minecraft story mode, Minecraft Earth, and Minecraft
        Dungeons.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As of today, Minecraft is still one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 240 million copies
        sold. Minecraft is more than just a game. Its popularity and impact on society have been transformed into
        movies, documentaries, novels, physical merchandise, and music. It has been applied to education and used in
        schools across North America. And during the Covid-19 pandemic, Minecraft served as a way to keep in touch with
        friends and play together while being socially distanced. Minecraft's success lies in its creativity,
        accessibility, and vibrant community, making it a timeless game loved by millions.

        <!-- <img src="../assets/Early_Minecraft.webp" alt="Description" class="wrapped-image" style="width: 25vw; height: auto;" /> -->
        <p>
          The corpses of those who died in the game were brought back to life in a way you know not. Zombies have been
          cursed to roam the overworld of Minecraft lashing out at any adventurers and villagers it sees. Whatever magic
          has reanimated these beings seem to fear the sunlight as they will burn during the day if not protected. With
          the power to turn those it kills into zombies themselves, be careful or you may be turned yourself.

      <Content_block_component title="Skeletons - Drops: Bones, Arrows, Bows">
        <p>
          Skeletons, too, are the reanimated remains of dead adventurers. Whatever magic has reanimated them extends
          beyond the flesh of these corpses and leads their bones to continue fighting adventurers.

      <Content_block_component title="Creepers - Drops: Gunpowder">
        <p>
          While mostly known for ruining builds, sneaking up on unwary adventurers, and exploding, Creepers have been
          found actually to be highly territorial plants. Their explosions evolved as a method of spreading their seeds
          around the overworld until eventually, they were able to break blocks. Though traditionally aggressive, if you
          were able to grow them from a seed it may be possible to tame them.

      </Content_block_component>


      <Content_block_component title="Spiders - Drops: String, Spider Eyes">
        <p>
          Spiders are aggressive if threatened, attacking during the night but staying neutral during the day. Spiders
          are especially dangerous in tight spaces with their ability to climb walls and lunge at adventurers. Spiders
          that have evolved to live underground are smaller and can poison those they attack, while spiders on the
          surface are naturally adaptable being able to become exceptionally fast, strong, hardy, or even having the
          ability to turn invisible.

      <Content_block_component title="Phantoms - Drops: Phantom Membranes">
        <p>
          After not sleeping in a bed for 3 days, Phantoms will begin to attack adventurers at night. These flying mobs
          are thought to be brought about by the same powers that animate Zombies and Skeletons although the reason for
          their appearance is still unknown. Cats are also known to scare away Phantoms.

      <Content_block_component title="Silverfish">
        <p>
          Known as pests, silverfish will hide away until found out, however, if attacked they will call upon other
          silverfish in the area to break out of the blocks they are hiding in and help them attack. Silverfish will not
          only burrow into blocks but also other mobs and adventurers, emerging when the host it is inhabiting is
          damaged.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Slime - Drops: Slime Balls">
        <p>
          Native to swamps and caves, Slimes are a highly sought-after mob due to the slime balls they drop being a rare
          resource required for many crafting recipes. Growing huge, slimes have the unique ability to split themselves
          when hurt and become many smaller slimes.

      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Guardians - Drops: Fish, Prismarine">
        <p>
          Guardians are pufferfish-like mobs that live in and around abandoned ocean monuments, relics of a lost
          civilization that lived beneath the waves. Guardians will shoot lasers at any adventurers who dare to get
          close, and its protective thorns make it hard for others to attack it. In the monuments themselves, the Elder
          Guardian emits an aura that fatigues those around making it impossible to break blocks or attack.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="The Warden - Drops: Skulk Catalyst">
        <p>
          The Warden is the defender of ancient cities that exist deep underground in Minecraft's overworld. Although
          blind, the Warden has an incredible sense of sight and smell allowing it to locate adventurers that make any
          noise throughout its home. The Warden will only arrive once any adventurers exploring its cities have made too
          much noise and alerted the warden to their location. The warden is one of the strongest mobs in the game,
          having an incredibly high amount of health and being able to kill adventurers in a single blow, attempting to
          fight the Warden is incredibly ill-advised.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Animals">
        <p>
          Throughout the overworld, various animals thrive, both kept domestically in villages and roaming wild in
          various biomes. Many villages will keep animals like cows, pigs, and sheep around for food and the resources
          they provide, and donkeys and llamas are used for transporting goods over long distances. As well as animals
          used for food, many animals, such as Cats, Parrots, and Wolves are kept as companions that help adventurers by
          fighting alongside them, scaring off various mobs, or just dancing and being cute.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Villagers">
        <p>
          Native to the overworld of Minecraft, Villagers live in a series of villages with varying degrees of seclusion
          from each other. While outside the game, Villagers are unintelligible to the player, in the game, you can
          understand their speech and the intricacies of their society. While Villager jobs seem highly simplified,
          Villagers have a wide range of individual abilities and employment, while a Villager might appear as a simple
          librarian, that Villager is most likely a literary expert on a certain era in Minecraft history. Beyond just
          individual Villagers having their personal lives and specialties, the life of a Villager differs between
          different biomes. Villagers have made ways to defend themselves through the creation of two types of Golems.
          Iron Golems are hulking humanoid beings brought to life by the Village priests to fight enemies directly, they
          are incredibly sturdy and hard to take down and will throw those they attack high in the air. Snow Golems are
          physically weaker than their counterparts, but have the ability to spontaneously create and throw Snowballs at
          their enemies from afar.

      <Content_block_component title="Savana Villagers">
        <p>
          Plains Villagers tend to lead a balanced, agrarian lifestyle, thriving on farming and animal husbandry.
          Farmers are the backbone of their society and the best farmers in the land can be found here.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Taiga Villagers">
        <p>
          Taiga Villagers are hardier and more practical than other Villagers, being adept at forestry and hunting.
          Their focus on hunting and forestry means the best fletchers and toolsmiths are found in this biome.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Snowy Villagers">
        <p>
          Snowy Villagers are survivors, having to survive the harsh cold of their homes has had them focus on finding
          ways to keep warm and finding food in the barren land that they live in. Long winters have made them rugged
          with a focus on warmth and durability in their tools and armour. Their dependence on fishing for food means
          the best fishermen come from this biome, and their leather workers are the best at crafting warm clothing.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Swamp Villagers">
        <p>
          Swamp villages are the most secluded of all the villages, avoiding trade with other villagers. Swamp Villagers
          worship nature in the swamp around them, using herbal medicines made from swamp plants and fungi. With their
          worship of nature, many of the priests coming from Swamp Villages are the best at brewing potions and many
          Witches originally come from Swamp Villages.

      <Content_block_component title="Illagers">
        <p>
          Closely related to Villagers, Illagers are a ragtag group of various exiled clans of Villagers who have come
          together to swear revenge on the villages that exiled them.
          Their connection with dark magic which is scorned by many Villages has turned their skin a greyish-blue.
          However, working with this dark magic has given them many powers such as summoning <span
            style="font-weight: bolder;"> Vexs </span> and <span style="font-weight: bolder;"> Ravagers </span> to
          attack Villagers and adventurers who are in their way, and even the power over life and death through their
          Totems of Undying.
          They attack villages in their area from their outposts and their main fortresses at woodland mansions they
          have built around the overworld.

      </div>

      <Content_block_component title="Desert Pyramid">
        <p>
          A Temple to a god the villagers call Father Sun, the Desert Pyramid serves as a place where desert Villagers
          go to give offerings, with inscriptions of Creepers on it's walls, a mob that is worshiped by desert
          Villagers, the offerings are protected in a fashion befitting the creeper, TNT hidden under the floor
          connected to a pressure plate in the middle of the room. Clever Robbers will know to fall into one of the
          corners and destroy the pressure plates before going through the chests, although that may anger the desert
          Villagers in the area.

      <Content_block_component title="Jungle Temples">
        <p>
          It's unclear who were the original builders of the Jungle Temples, hidden deep within the jungle, they appear
          largely dilapidated showing their original builders have long since abandoned it. Any potential robbers should
          be wary though, not only are there traps but there is hidden treasure in this temple if you can figure out the
          secret code.

      <Content_block_component title="Ocean Monuments">
        <p>
          Built by ancient, now sunken civilizations, Ocean Monuments were lost beneath the waves and abandoned. Built
          as monuments to now long forgotten gods, it is known that gold and sponges lie inside, however those who seek
          them out should be warned, they have become the home of powerful guardians, and at their center sits the elder
          guardian that will make mining into or out of the monument impossible.

          allow adventurers to reach the End. Among their many labyrinthian halls also sit the writings of those who
          have tried to escape before, which may hold knowledge to help delegates survive.

        <p>
          Once peaceful, these undead remnants of Piglins roam the Nether in groups. They remain neutral unless
          provoked, at which point they will swarm their attacker with relentless aggression. Zombie Piglins are immune
          to fire and lava, making them an ever-present danger in the fiery depths.

      <Content_block_component title="Ghasts - Drops: Ghast Tears, Gunpowder">
        <p>
          Large, ghostly creatures that float through the Nether, Ghasts attack by firing explosive fireballs. Their
          mournful cries echo through the vast lava-filled caverns, often giving adventurers chills. While they are
          deadly, their drops are essential for crafting potions and other valuable items.

      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="Blazes - Drops: Blaze Rods">
        <p>
          Blazes are fiery, floating mobs found exclusively in Nether Fortresses. Their ability to shoot fireballs and
          resist most forms of fire damage makes them formidable foes. Blaze rods are a crucial resource for brewing
          potions and activating the End Portal.

      <Content_block_component title="Magma Cubes - Drops: Magma Cream">
        <p>
          Similar to overworld Slimes, Magma Cubes are fiery blobs that split into smaller versions when attacked. Found
          in Nether Fortresses or Basalt Deltas, they are a significant source of Magma Cream, which is used to craft
          Fire Resistance potions.

      <Content_block_component title="Striders - Drops: String">
        <p>
          Striders are passive, lava-walking creatures that can be ridden using a saddle and a warped fungus on a stick.
          These mobs provide a safe means of traversing lava lakes, making them invaluable for exploration in the
          Nether.

      <Content_block_component title="Wither Skeletons - Drops: Bones, Coal, Wither Skeleton Skulls">
        <p>
          Tall, dark, and deadly, Wither Skeletons roam Nether Fortresses. Their attacks inflict the Wither effect, a
          devastating status ailment that saps health over time. Collecting their skulls is necessary for summoning the
          Wither.
        </p>
      </Content_block_component>

      <Content_block_component title="The Wither - Drops: Nether Star">
        <p>
          The Wither is a creature shrouded in mystery and dread, believed by many to be an ancient, forbidden creation
          tied to the darkest magics of the Nether. Unlike other mobs, the Wither does not naturally exist in the
          world—it must be summoned. The ritual requires Wither Skeleton skulls, obtained from the deadly guardians of
          Nether Fortresses, and soul sand or soul soil, materials infused with the essence of the Nether's restless
          dead. This combination hints at the Wither's dark origins, born from a fusion of death and the Nether's
          malevolent power. The Nether Star it drops upon defeat further deepens the mystery. This rare and radiant
          artifact, capable of crafting a beacon of immense power, suggests the Wither was tied to an ancient knowledge
          of light, energy, and magic.

      <Content_block_component title="Piglins">
        <p>
          Piglins are intelligent, humanoid creatures that thrive in the Nether living in their bastions and led by Brutes who rule through strength. They are highly attracted to gold and will become hostile if a player does not wear at least one piece of gold armour. However, adventurers can barter with Piglins, exchanging gold for valuable items like Ender Pearls, Obsidian, and Fire Resistance potions. To the Piglins, gold is more than just a resource—it's a symbol of status, power, and respect. Crafty adventurers could be able to persuade Piglins to aid them with gold and some clever negotiations.

          The Endermen are the primary inhabitants of the End and are shrouded in mystery. These tall, shadowy beings are capable of teleportation and carrying blocks, which suggests they are more than just mindless creatures. They seem to posses some form of speech however it is too distorted to be understood. It has also been theorized that the endermen are able to teleport not only through space but also through time.

          The towering End Cities, built from purple blocks and decorated with banners, are remnants of an advanced civilization that once thrived in the End. These cities suggest a society capable of remarkable engineering, adapting to the void's harsh environment. Seeming to depart from End Cities are flying ships, helmed by a dragon's head suggesting its capability of sustained flight.

          Chorus plants and flowers are the only organic life native to the End, thriving in the barren landscape. These strange, purple plants grow to impressive heights and can teleport anyone who eats their fruit. It is thought that the Chorus fruit might give us a glimpse into the origins of the Endermen themselves.

          Deep beneath the overworld lies a mysterious substance known as redstone, a glowing ore with properties unlike anything else. Redstone is more than a simple mineral—it's a conduit for energy, capable of powering machines, lighting pathways, and even unlocking ancient mechanisms. Ancient civilizations may have harnessed its power to create complex systems, remnants of which can be seen in temples and strongholds. Redstones conducting abilities enable the creation of intricate contraptions far beyond what mortal hands could craft alone.

      <Content_block_component title="Enchantments">
        <p>
          The process of enchanting is both an art and a mystery. By channeling energy from lapis lazuli through an enchantment table, adventurers can imbue their tools, weapons, and armor with powerful effects. The runic symbols that swirl across the table hint at a forgotten language, one possibly spoken by the builders of strongholds or End cities. It's said that these enchantments tap into the very fabric of the world, drawing on ancient, unseen forces. While the results are undeniably powerful, the exact nature of how enchantments work remains an enigma—are they merely practical tools, or is the user dabbling in a forgotten magic that once shaped the world?

          Herobrine is a legendary figure in Minecraft lore, but it's important to note that Herobrine is not an official character or mob within the game. Instead, the concept of Herobrine has evolved as a popular creepypasta—a type of internet horror story—created by the Minecraft community. The legend of Herobrine has become one of the most famous and enduring myths in the game's history, or at least you hope it's a myth.

        <p>
          The backstory of Herobrine is often linked to the idea that he is the brother of Notch, the game's original creator. According to the myth, Herobrine was removed from the game after causing chaos, but he continues to haunt players in their worlds, performing strange and unsettling actions.

        <p>
          It is said that Herobrine is summoned at an altar made of gold blocks, netherrack, and redstone torches. One of the supposed signs that Herobrine is in your world is oak forests with all the leaves cut down.
