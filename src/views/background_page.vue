      <p>
        Minecraft originally started as a simple sandbox game where players could interact with the
        world and build upon it in any way they desired. The sandbox aspect of the game appealed to
        much of the world and Minecraft became the most influential sandbox game to ever hit the
        video game market. In its early days, Minecraft coincided with the launch of the popular
        video viewing platform called YouTube, leading people to naturally start making content
        on the game itself. The 2010's era was dominated by what are known as “Minecraft Let's Play”
        where content creators would simply record themselves playing the game and navigating their
        own worlds. Viewers would become invested in the worlds and the different developments that
        occurred every single episode. This highly popular form of videos became the main type of
        content for the game Minecraft and would end up seeing millions upon millions of people
        viewing them.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Building upon the Let's Play genre, Minecraft would see many other trends enter its content sphere
        as well, including music videos, minigames, mod reviews, server gameplay and much more.
        One of these trends is known as the Minecraft Survival Multiplayer servers,
        known as Minecraft SMP servers. These servers provided a collaborative environment where players
        would interact within the same world, creating intricate storylines for each of the players and
        an overarching storyline as well. Players typically also engaged in large-scale builds,
        fostering vibrant communities that watched them as well. Out of all the SMP servers,
        two of the most popular ones were the HermitCraft SMP and the DreamSMP.

      <p>
        Launched in 2012, Hermitcraft began as a simple survival server for a small group of
        Minecraft content creators, known as the <span style="font-weight: bolder">Hermits</span>. The concept was
        simple: play survival Minecraft
        together, share their adventures on YouTube, and collaborate on large projects.
        However, it quickly grew into a prestigious, invite-only server featuring some of the most
        skilled builders, redstone engineers, and storytellers in the Minecraft community. They featured
        their SMP server in seasons where every season they would reset the world to introduce new challenges,
        features and unique themes to differentiate the story. Each season offers its own distinct narrative
        and showcases the creativity of the Hermits.
        Prominent events of the HermitCraft SMP from each season include:

            infamous Purge Event where Hermits could engage in anarchy, griefing, looting and PvP battles
            for a short period of time.
            The dynamic of the server changed and became much more thrilling, throwing into question chaos versus order.

            Building on the storytelling aspect brought by Grian, two factions emerged:
            the Mycelium Resistance led by Grian and the Hermit Environmental Protection led by Mumbo Jumbo.
            These two factions would inevitably enter into an event called the Civil War that brought
            conflict over the shopping district using elaborate pranks and sabotage. This season would end up
            being extremely story rich, playing heavily on the concepts of roleplay and drama.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="list-element">

            A shorter season focused around the Moon Crash event where Hermits and
            viewers noticed the moon growing larger over time, leaving fans speculating its cause.
            Ultimately, it culminated in a server-wide catastrophe and showcased HermitCraft's ability
            to create suspenseful, server-wide arcs that had hundreds of thousands of people engaged.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="list-element">
          <span class="list-header">Season 9:</span>
          <div class="list-content">
            Focused mainly upon Hermit Empires, where the various players formed factions together
            and started building interconnected bases. This season delved deep into diplomacy, trade and competition,
            with each empire showing off its Hermits' strengths and unique skills.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Overall, HermitCraft started the trend of story-focused SMP servers that would develop over
        time to become more
        and more life-like mimicking many of the structures we see in everyday life.

    <Content_block_component title="Dream SMP">
      <img src="../assets/dreamSMP.jpg" alt="DreamSMP" class="wrapped-image" />
      <p>
        The DreamSMP began in April 2020, with Dream inviting prominent creators such as TommyInnit,
        Technoblade and Tubbo to join him in a simple SMP server. At the start, the server dealt
        with very casual gameplay where creators would join and simply entertain their audience
        with Minecraft gameplay and the small interactions between one another. The storyline
        very quickly evolved over time and shifted more towards a complex narrative involving
        themes of politics, betrayal and power struggles, bringing upon the resurgence of
        Minecraft and captivating millions of viewers. Dream, being an influential creator
        himself, became infamous in the community for always wearing a mask and working with
        many popular creators to stream on the DreamSMP and create its story.

    <Content_block_component title="Origins">
      <p>
        The first and starting major conflict arose between Dream and TommyInnit.
        With Dream having collected music discs from dungeons and keeping them as a prize,
        TommyInnit went out and stole his discs leading himself to get exiled and signalling
        the start of the Disc Saga, a storyline centered around Tommy's quest to reclaim
        his discs (a possession he would talk about dearly and symbolizing freedom and friendship).
        This Disc Saga would continue to make appearances in every single arc, showing itself as
        the server's overarching plot with Dream as the villain who wanted to keep authority
        over the server, while TommyInnit served as the hero of the story fighting against
        an oppressive leader/dictator.

    <Content_block_component title="L'Manberg">
      <img src="../assets/Flag_of_L_Manberg.png" alt="DreamSMP" class="wrapped-image" />
      <p>
        Wilbur Soot founded the nation of L'Manberg that became independent from the rest of
        the DreamSMP and showed off its rebellion against Dream's authority on the server.
        The nation's declaration of independence lead to the L'Manberg War of Independence,
        where Wilbur and his allies fought Dream for sovereignty and ended up defeating the titan.
        A newly independent L'Manberg continued on with its on flag and elections, but started to face
        internal conflicts and external threats.
      </p>

    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Election and Civil War">
      <p>
        Following L'Manberg's newfound independence, the nation held an election for its next leader. Creator J'Schlatt won the election due to a controversial coalition with another party running. Schlatt's authoritarian rule incited the creation of the Pogtopia resistance led by Wilbur Soot and TommyInnit. This resistance would end up raising a civil war, resulting in Schlatt's defeat. Wilbur Soot, however, being completely disillusioned by the war and feeling betrayed by TommyInnit ends up blowing up L'Manberg, leaving only remnants left of what used to be a nation.
      </p>

    </Content_block_component>
    
    <Content_block_component title="Anarchy">
      <p>
        Following the destruction of the SMP's only nation, anarchy ensued. Technoblade, an anarchist, grew in influence and opposed governments that were created in the SMP. He led a group called The Syndicate that had as a goal to destroy all authority within the DreamSMP, which led to the destabilization of the server's political structure and bringing about contentious times.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="Eggpire Arc">
      <p>
        Amidst the chaos, a mysterious Red Egg appeared on the server, corrupting its players. Led by BadBoyHalo and other members, the Eggpire sought to control the SMP through manipulation and fear. This arc played on much darker themes than the server has seen so far as players tried to resist the Egg's power.
      </p>
    </Content_block_component>

    <Content_block_component title="The End of the Disc Arc">
      <p>
        Throughout the entire series, the original Disc Saga still strung on with Dream and TommyInnit constantly at each other trying to become the ultimate owner of the discs. This arc would culminate in an intense showdown between Dream and Tommy where Dream would be imprisoned by the entirety of the rest of the server, marking the end of his reign of terror. The DreamSMP was now free.
      </p>

      <p>
        With its incredibly high viewership and enticing and unique storylines, the DreamSMP ignited an exciting era in Minecraft's history focused around story-telling and exploring the themes of power, loyalty, and betrayal. Each player had their own unique arc and the amount of character depth as well as unexpected twists kept millions of viewers engaged. To this day, the DreamSMP remains the most influential SMP server in Minecraft's history, redefining what players could achieve through Minecraft storytelling.
